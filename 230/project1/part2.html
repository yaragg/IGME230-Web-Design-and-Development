		<h3>Instructions</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<span class="step">Make use of your mistakes. </span>
				<p class="explanation">Find those weird spots in your map that I didn't allow you to erase. They can be a source of interesting information about your countries! Try to come up with imaginative explanations. For example, in this map, the borders between Adrax and Wodrein seem a little too neat: maybe both countries made some sort of treaty. The western border in Astea does a weird loopy thing: maybe there is a really dangerous swamp that the country hasn't been able to conquer. In case you've noticed, I forgot to complete the Truconia/Rusniles border, there's a bit of a blank north of Obros. Maybe it's a region that is dominated by some kind of enchanted fog no one has been able to cross -- hence the borders not being clear. There is an excuse for everything!</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<span class="step">Look closely at your mountains.</span>
				<p class="explanation">Those high school Geography classes can help you figure out information about your countries. If you have a big mountain range near the sea, like in western Eflines, chances are any humidity that the wind would carry from the sea will get trapped by the mountains, so there will be a lot of rain around the mountains but I will have very dry climate to the east of the Preustan Mountains.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<span class="step">Mind your rivers.</span>
				<p class="explanation">See how Atrana has a lot of rivers? The Asvya and Braecia rivers also happen to be their borders. Water might be very important for Atrani culture, and they might be good at agriculture. I might also draw inspiration from Mesopotamian culture (after all, Mesopotamia literally means 'between rivers').</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<span class="step">Look at your countries' proximity to the sea. </span>
				<p class="explanation">If you have your continent borders, that is. Access to the sea is very important for commerce. See how Rusniles doesn't have direct access, because Truconia pretty much encircles it and takes up all the coast? I would bet those two countries have been at war quite a few times over it. Maybe the fact that they can never reach the sea is a particularly sore point in Rusnilian culture.</p>
