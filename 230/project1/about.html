		<h3>What's this tutorial about?</h3>

		This tutorial gives some suggestions about how to draw a map for a fictional world and how to derive information for worldbuilding from your new map. I made it with a high fantasy setting in mind, but it should work for other kinds of settings as well.

	<div class="section">
		<h3>Why this theme?</h3>

		My biggest passion and pasttime is writing high fantasy. As such, I've had to do a ton of worldbuilding. It's a really fun thing to do, so why not do it and homework at the same time? A few years ago I found this method by Holly Lisle that really helped me out, and thought I might practice it some more and share it.

	<div class="section">
		<h3>Above and beyond</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Used custom fonts</li>
			<li>Tried to make things pretty with pictures</li>
			<li>Used thumbnails for the tutorial photos so the pictures wouldn't use up too much screen space</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h3>How I could have improved</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>I still haven't managed to make the compass picture resize along with the window, and it doesn't move along with the navigation bar. I wish I could have fixed that.</li>
			<li>The thumbnails still feel a little out of place. I could have tried to make them fit in a little better somehow.</li>
		</ul>
