	<p>This was a four-person project made for the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">2015 Global Game Jam</a>, the theme for which was <em>"What do we do now?"</em>. It's a puzzle game where the player, who controls a friendly ghost, must move the boxes in order to free up a path leading to the exit all the while trapping enemies and preventing them from killing the human.</p>

	<p>The original concept for the game was made in RPG Maker XP, but the game itself was developed in <em>Construct 2</em>. It may be downloaded from <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/we-only-missed-bots">the project page</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/mvcds/global-game-jam-2015">the repository page</a>. It may also <a href="https://db.tt/0RxvCElS">be played online</a>.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><em>Time,</em> as with every game jam. We had only one weekend to make a complete game from the ground up.</li>
		<li><em>Team play.</em> None of the four of us had ever met each other before, and we each had very different backgrounds.</li>
		<li><em>Experience.</em> It was our first time ever in a game jam. Most of us hadn't ever really worked on a game before either.</li>
		<li><em>Level design.</em> It can make or break a puzzle game, and none of us were very knowledgeable in it.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>My part in it</h2>

	I'm a bit of a jack of all trades, so I took on multiple roles in the team:

	<ul>
		<li><em>Soundtrack and SFX.</em> I came up with the soundtrack (which I generated using <a href="http://abundant-music.com/">Abundant Music</a>) and picked sound effects.</li>
		<li><em>Level design.</em> I designed the challenge levels (the last two out of four total).</li>
		<li><em>Programming.</em> I joined in for development whenever the main programmers needed help, and solved bugs while they worked.</li>
		<li><em>Administration.</em> I kept track of time and of the team's progress and handled files, assets and distribution.</li>
	</ul>
