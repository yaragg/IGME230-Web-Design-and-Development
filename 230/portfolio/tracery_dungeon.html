	<p>This was a project for my Digital Literature class at Rochester Institute of Technology. It was made using the <a href="https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery">Tracery JavaScript library</a>.</p>

	<p>This is a work of generative text that tells the story of an adventurer exploring a dungeon, following common tropes in dungeon crawl games such as <a href="https://crawl.develz.org/">Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</a>. Each time a new story is generated, details such the hero's name, class and origins as well as where he goes, what monsters he fights, what traps he faces or even if he lives or dies are randomly decided. Will your hero suffer an untimely death victim to an angry troll, or will he make it to the depths of the dungeon? Read and find out! And if you're not happy with the conclusion, just generate another story!</p>
