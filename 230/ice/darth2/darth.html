				<dd><b>Piett</b>: I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment, from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had.</dd>
				<dd><b>Ozzel</b>: <i>[growing impatient]</i> We have <i>thousands</i> of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want <i>proof</i>, not leads!</dd>

				<dd><b>Darth Vader</b>: What is it, General?</dd>
				<dd><b>General Veers</b>: My Lord, the fleet has moved out of lightspeed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.</dd>

				<dd><b>Vader</b>: I have felt it.</dd>
				<dd><b>Palpatine</b>: We have a new enemy. The young Rebel who destroyed the Death Star. I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</dd>
				<dd><b>Vader</b>: How is that possible?</dd>
				<dd><b>Palpatine</b>: Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true. He could destroy us.</dd>
				<dd><b>Vader</b>: He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.</dd>
				<dd><b>Palpatine</b>: The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.</dd>

				<dd><b>Luke</b>: Master, moving stones around is one thing, but this is... totally different!</dd>
				<dd><b>Yoda</b>: No! <i>No</i> different! Only different in your mind. You must <i>unlearn</i> what you have learned.</dd>
				<dd><b>Luke</b>: All right, I'll give it a try.</dd>
				<dd><b>Yoda</b>: No! Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.</dd>

				<dd><b>Luke</b>: I can't. It's too big.</dd>
				<dd><b>Yoda</b>: Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship.</dd>
